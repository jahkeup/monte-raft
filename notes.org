* Todo List

** TODO Make handlers
*** handle-ping
    Nothing too special here.
*** handle-confirm
    Very straightforward, respond CONFIRMED if the transient is there.
*** handle-commit
    Very straightforward as well, simply update the =state= atom and
    then respond. Will send =RETRY= if the state object seems to be missing.
*** handle-elect
    Need to figure out how the leader piece will interact with node
    and define that more clearly before I go forward with this handler.
*** handle-term
    This will also need some more thought.

** TODO Clear transient-state after a timeout

** TODO Figure out leader "worker thread" calling and bindings.

** TODO Consider another more flexible handler methodology
