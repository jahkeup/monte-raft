* Heartbeat

  Leaders will request heartbeats from nodes. 
  Nodes will respond. See [[*Commands for control socket][commands]].

* Leader Elections

  The heartbeat port will also serve voting requests. 
  Upon a "vote" message, a node will respond with a vote assuming it
  has not already voted. If a node has already voted a vote will not
  be cast, and send a "no-vote" message.
